Economy

economic system: a way by which a society or government allocates available resources such as land, capital and labor etc and produces and distributes goods, services and wealth. It encompasses the institutions, policies, and procedures that provide for structures, methods and regulations for economic activities and relationships among individuals and organizations within a society. An economic system addresses three questions: what goods and services should be produced, how to produce them and for whom to produce.

economic system type/traditional economy: the oldest model of the economic system which relies on customs, traditions, and beliefs to make economic decisions. Economic activities are often based on agriculture, hunting, fishing, and gathering. It is highly stable and sustainable with a strong sense of community. Absence of economic hierarchy results in a lack of economic competition. Members of a community or society are more satisfied with their social role which normally doesn’t change.There is rarely any surplus in goods or resources. Technological advancement is limited. The standard of living is lower.

economic system type/command economy: also called planned economic system where the government or a central authority makes all economic decisions, controls all economic resources, activities and transactions. It can quickly mobilize resources, however it is rigid and reacts slowly to changes. It also lacks efficiency and innovation and can lead to shortages or surpluses.

economic system type/market economy: the government doesn’t interfere or exercises little control over economic resources and activities, leaving economic decisions to the market forces of supply and demand. Prices for goods and services are determined by the free market. Individuals have the freedom to make their own economic choices. It is characterized by high efficiency and innovation and provides a wide variety of goods and services. However it can lead to inequality, market failures and lack of public goods.

economic system type/mixed economy: it combines elements of both command and market economies i.e. the government intervenes in certain areas such as regulation, public services, welfare systems etc. while the free market operates in others. It balances efficiency with social welfare and provides public goods and services. However, it faces the challenge of finding the right balance between free markets and government control, and has potential for government overreach. Depending on the extent to which the government intervenes in economic decisions, the mixed economy comes in various types and shapes.

economic system type/capitalism: private actors i.e. individuals or private-owned entities own and control capital assets, i.e. the means of production such as land, machinery, tools, technology, and purchase labor by paying wages with the motive to make a profit for self-interest. Private property rights are fundamental to capitalism. 

economic system type/socialism: while individuals can still own property, the state on behalf of the public owns and controls the capital assets i.e. the means of production such as land, machinery, tools and technology etc. The state-owned enterprises maximize the social good rather than profit. It tends to have robust welfare systems and social safety nets so that individuals rely on the state for everything from food to healthcare. The primary goal of socialism is to achieve a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources, thereby reducing social and economic inequalities.


economic system type/communism: all property is communally owned, and each person receives a portion based on what they need. A strong central government controls all aspects of economic production, with the aim of eliminating private ownership and achieving complete social and economic equality. 

economic cycle: also called business cycle, refers to the fluctuation of economic activity i.e alternating periods of expansion and contraction, which includes four stages i.e. expansion, peak, contraction or recession, and trough. Real GDP growth and unemployment rate are two key criteria for measuring the economic cycle. A generally accepted rule is that two consecutive quarters of growth in real GDP are the beginning of an expansion, and two successive quarters of declining real GDP indicate the start of a contraction.

economy development level: a country or a region’s economic development status which is usually measured by the standard of living i.e. per capita income and per capita GDP, the level of infrastructure development, the diversification of industrial and service sectors. Other metrics include the effectiveness of governance, the robustness of the legal system and the development of financial markets. Non-economic factors, such as the human development index (HDI), which quantifies a country's levels of education, literacy, and health into a single figure, can also be used to evaluate an economy or the degree of development.

human development index: abbreviated as HD, is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: the health dimension, the education dimension and the standard of living dimension. The health dimension is assessed by life expectancy at birth, the education dimension is measured by the mean of years of schooling for adults aged 25 years and more, and expected years of schooling for children of school entering age. The standard of living dimension is measured by gross national income per capita.

unemployment rate: the percentage of people in the labor force who are unemployed. The labor force is the working age population excluding those who do not look for a job, retired or permanently unable to work.

cyclical unemployment: unemployment resulting from the cycle of the economy during recessions. It generally rises during economic recession and falls during economic expansion. Governments may use monetary policy, such as reducing interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending, thereby increasing aggregate demand, or use fiscal policy, such as increasing spending on infrastructure projects, providing tax cuts, or offering direct stimulus payments to boost aggregate demand and create jobs.

structural unemployment: unemployment resulting from the fundamental shift that causes the mismatch of supply and demand of certain skills in the labor market, i.e. the job-seeker’s skills are not relevant to the available jobs. Structural changes, such as technological advancements or shifts in industries, can contribute to this type of unemployment. Government can help job-seekers to learn new skills, to change industry, or even move to new locations. Job-seekers will have to be willing to do the same. 

frictional unemployment: unemployment resulting from the time it takes for people to find new jobs that match their skills and preferences. This type of unemployment is usually short-term. It occurs in the normal job search process. 

natural unemployment rate: The unemployment rate that exists in a growing and healthy economy, which includes only frictional unemployment i.e. short-term unemployment during normal job change, and structural unemployment i. e. unemployment due to fundamental shift in technology, industry etc,  but not cyclical unemployment i. e. unemployment due to economic recessions. 

Inflation: the gradual loss of purchasing power, reflected in a broad rise in prices for goods and services in a country. The most widely used measure of inflation is consumer price index i.e. CPI, which tracks the price increase of a basket of commonly purchased items.Generally there are two types of inflation. Demand-pull inflation occurs when the demand for goods and services in the economy exceeds the economy’s ability to produce them. Cost-push inflation occurs when the rising price of input goods and services increases the price of final goods and services. In a healthy economy, annual inflation is typically in the range of two percentage points, a sign of pricing stability. Inflation within this range can stimulate spending and thus spur demand and productivity when the economy is slowing down and needs a boost. But when inflation begins to surpass wage growth, it can be a warning sign of a struggling economy.  Expectation of future inflation can accelerate the inflation. When high inflation occurs, governments may use monetary policy e.g. raise interest rate and increase money supply, or fiscal policy e.g reduce government spending and increase tax, reduce the demand. The other measures include: improve supply chain efficiency to alleviate supply-side inflationary pressure, encourage productivity growth to reduce production cost, implement temporary price controls on essential goods and services, provide subsidies to vulnerable groups, keep clear communications about policies and follow through these policies to maintain credibility.

deflation: occurs when the overall level of prices in a country declines and the purchasing power of currency increases. It can be driven by growth in productivity and the abundance of goods and services, by a decrease in demand, or by a decline in the supply of money and credit. When deflation happens, governments may lower interest and increase money supply, increase government spending and lower tax to increase demand.

minimum wage: the lowest amount of pay that employers are legally required to offer their employees. This rate is set by law and varies depending on the country, state, or region. The goal of minimum wage laws is to ensure that workers receive a basic standard of living for their labor.

social welfare system: government programs to provide financial and material assistance to individuals and families who cannot support themselves on basic living needs. The assistance include income support e.g. giving vouchers, cash etc, healthcare services, education, housing assistance and child care etc.. Social welfare system is on a need basis.

social security system:government programs designed to provide financial protection and support to individuals and families during times of economic hardship or uncertainty. It typically includes a variety of benefits aimed at ensuring that people have a basic standard of living, especially in retirement, during periods of unemployment, or in cases of disability. Social Security is an insurance program. Workers pay into the program, typically through payroll withholding from their paychecks. 

welfare state: a state that is committed to providing basic economic security for its citizens by protecting them from risks associated with old age, unemployment, accidents, and sickness. 

industry: a group of business entities and their business activities that produce similar products or offer similar services. Broadly, there are four category:  primary industry - include agriculture, forestry, livestock management, fishing, mining of mineral ores, quarrying of stone, and extraction of mineral fuels; secondary industry - manufacturing, which takes the raw materials and processes them into consumer products, or builds capital equipment used to manufacture consumer and non consumer good, also includes energy-producing and construction; tertiary - services, which include banking, finance, insurance, investment, real estate services,  wholesale, retail, and resale trade,  transportation services, professional, consulting, legal, and personal services, tourism, hotels, restaurants, and entertainment services, repair and maintenance services, and health, social welfare, administrative, police, security, and defense services;  quaternary - information-based or knowledge-oriented products and services,  including information systems and technology, research and development, media and communications, and education. Under the four broad categories, there are further classifications.  One of the various existing classification standards, the Global Industry Classification Standard, consists of 11 sectors, 25 industry groups, 74 industries and 163 sub industries.

Industry structure: the composition and characteristics of an industry that influence how business entities within the industry operate and compete. Key elements of industry structure include: market share distribution - measures how market share and power is distributed among competing business entities. It may be a monopoly where a single business entity controls the entire market and can set prices without direct competition; or a oligopoly where a small number of dominant business entities have significant market power; or monopolistic competition where many business entities offer competing products and services that are similar but differentiated; or perfect competition where many firms offer identical products, and no single firm has significant market power. Barriers to entry - high barriers means significant costs or difficulties that new business entities face when entering an industry, such as high capital requirements, economies of scale, or strong brand loyalty, while low barriers means that new business entities can enter the industry more easily, leading to more competition and potentially lower profitability for existing business entities. Competitive dynamics - competing primarily through pricing strategies, which can lead to price wars or price leadership or through product differentiation, quality improvements, and marketing efforts to attract customers. Supply chain and distribution -  the methods and channels through which business entities conduct sourcing and procurement, manufacturing or services offering, distribution or delivery of products or services to customers. Technology and innovation - can disrupt industry structures by introducing new ways of production, creating new products, or changing competitive dynamics. Regulatory environment - rules and policies that affect how business entities operate, including safety standards, environmental regulations, and antitrust laws.
